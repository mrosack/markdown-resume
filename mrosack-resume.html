<li><strong>ZeroMe</strong>: Worked on API, web portal and mobile
application for <a href="https://www.zerome.com/">zerome.com</a>. The
portal and mobile app were developed in React, using React Native and
Expo on mobile. The API is graphql-based with an Azure CosmosDB backend.

user carbon emissions which I was heavily involved in.</li>
<li><strong>AskFELIX.com</strong>: Brought in near the end of
development for <a href="https://askfelix.com">AskFELIX.com</a>, a
rewrite of Breakthrough’s main customer-facing application. I lead the
development of an updated pricing system to take over from a bunch of
manual legacy processes that had yet to be replaced in the new platform.
I was also investigating integration of alternative fuels into the
platform as part of the pricing process. All development was in
Node/React/GraphQL with a PostgreSQL database in the Google cloud.</li>

<p>Modernized <a href="yearli.com">yearli.com</a> to run in the Azure
cloud instead of on premises. My main focus was on the form validation
engine/UI - the main concern was being able to have a highly functional
UI that could run the same full validation that was done on the backend.
We developed a custom metadata solution to create the business logic and
transpiled the validation engine to Javascript using bridge.net.</p>
